  3. Then execute this command in the terminal "source ~/.bashrc"
  4. BOOM! Thats all you have to do.

> See .bash_profile for the available functions.
> one of them is, "codeforces" which takes in the contest id and creates directories for each problem containing template code and sample input and output files from the website.
> Another one is "grade" function which compiles the given 'c' or 'cpp' file, runs it against the input files and checks if it matches the expected output and gives the verdict.

NOTE:
  All the file names should be preserved during copying.
